   </p>

Introduction to P4 and BMv2
===========================

This lab introduces programmable data plane switches and their role in the 
Software-defined Networking (SDN) paradigm. The lab introduces the Programming 
Protocol-independent Packet Processors (P4), the de facto programming language 
used to describe the behavior of the data planes of programmable switches. 
The focus of this lab is to provide a high-level overview of the general lifecycle
of programming, compiling, and running a P4 program on a software switch.
